node-red-node-coffee
====================

This is a similar node to the 'function'-node, which allows custom javascript to be executed (in a sandbox).
This node will allow the enduser to use beautifull compact (sandboxed) coffeescript.

# Installation

This is a drop-in node, so just put the files into your /nodes directory somewhere.

Also make sure to run: npm install coffee-script

# Extra notes

I love Node-red!
